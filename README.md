## üìö Exercises

### Exercise 1: Formatted Twinkle Poem üìú

Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format (see the output).

**Sample String:**
```
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
	How I wonder what you are! 
		Up above the world so high,   		
		Like a diamond in the sky. 
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 
	How I wonder what you are
```

**File:** ex1.py

### Exercise 2: Python Version üêç

Write a Python program to get the Python version you are using. 
Your program should display both the version number and the detailed version information.

**Expected Output (example):**
```
Python version: 3.9.5
Version info: sys.version_info(major=3, minor=9, micro=5, releaselevel='final', serial=0)
```

**File:** ex2.py

### Exercise 3: Current Date and Time üìÖ

Write a Python program to display the current date and time. Your program should show the date and time separately in a formatted way.

**Expected Output (example):**
```
Current date: 2023-03-09
Current time: 15:32:45
Current date and time: 2023-03-09 15:32:45
```

**Hint:** Use the `datetime` module.

**File:** ex3.py

### Exercise 4: Area of a Circle üìè

Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and computes the area.

**Formula:** Area = œÄ √ó r¬≤

**Expected Output (example):**
```
Input the radius of the circle: 1.5
The area of the circle with radius 1.5 is: 7.07
```

**Note:** Format the output to 2 decimal places.

**File:** ex4.py

### Exercise 5: Name Formatter üìã

Write a Python program that takes a first name and a last name from the user and prints them in a specific format with the greeting "Hi".

**Expected Output (example):**
```
Enter your first name: Ferhat
Enter your last name: U√ßar

Hi      U√ßar
  Ferhat
```

**Note:** The last name should appear aligned with the end of "Hi" on the first line, and the first name should be aligned with the first character of the last name.

**File:** ex5.py

### Exercise 6: List Manipulator üìä

Write a Python program that creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10, then performs the following operations:
1. Print the original list
2. Reverse the list and print it
3. Add the numbers 11, 12, and 13 to the list and print it
4. Print the list's length
5. Remove the first and last elements, then print the list
6. Create and print a new sorted list containing only even numbers from the original list

**File:** ex6.py

### Exercise 7: Character Frequency Counter üî§

Write a Python program that asks the user to input a string and counts the frequency of each character in the string. 
The program should print each character and its count, sorted by character.

**Expected Output (example):**
```
Enter a string: programming
Character frequencies:
a: 1
g: 2
i: 1
m: 2
n: 1
o: 1
p: 1
r: 2
```

**File:** ex7.py

### Exercise 8: Pyramid Pattern ‚ú®

Write a Python program that asks the user for a number n and prints a pyramid pattern using asterisks (*) with n rows.

**Expected Output (for n=5):**
```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

**Note:** Pay attention to the spacing to create a perfect pyramid shape.

**File:** ex8.py

### Exercise 9: Temperature Converter üå°Ô∏è

Write a Python program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The program should:
1. Ask the user which conversion they want to perform (C to F or F to C)
2. Ask for the temperature value
3. Display the converted value with appropriate units

**Formulas:**
- Celsius to Fahrenheit: (C √ó 9/5) + 32
- Fahrenheit to Celsius: (F - 32) √ó 5/9

**File:** ex9.py

### Exercise 10: Simple Calculator üßÆ

Write a Python program that functions as a simple calculator. It should:
1. Ask the user for two numbers
2. Ask for an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division)
3. Perform the operation and display the result
4. Handle division by zero and invalid operation errors appropriately
5. Ask if the user wants to perform another calculation

**File:** ex10.py
